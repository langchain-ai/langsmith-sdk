[lib]
# "cdylib" is necessary to produce a shared library for Node.js to import from.
# "rlib" is what Rust uses to use this crate as a library, for example in tests, benchmarks,
#    examples, or Rust binaries built using this library.
#
# Downstream *Rust* code (including any code in `bin/`, `examples/`, and `tests/`) will not be able
# to `use langsmith_nodejs;` unless the "rlib" or "lib" crate type is also included.
