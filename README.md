# LangSmith Client SDKs

This repository contains `BaseTracer` schemas used in LangChain as well as the Python and Javascript clients for interacting with the [LangSmith platform](https://smith.langchain.com/).

LangSmith helps you and your team debug, evaluate, and monitor your language models and intelligent agents. It works
with any LLM Application, including a native integration with the [LangChain Python](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) and [LangChain JS](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs) open source libraries.

LangSmith is developed and maintained by [LangChain](https://langchain.com/), the company behind the LangChain framework.

⚠️ The SDK and LangSmith platform is still in early beta and continuously evolving!
